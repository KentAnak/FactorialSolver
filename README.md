# FactorialSolver
 Computation tool for solving factorial problems

Have you ever seen a problem like the following?<br>
"Find the smallest n such that n! ends in 290 zeros"(HMMT, 2003).<br>

Legendre's formula can be used in such cases.<br>
I actually wrote some Java code to check it out.<br>

This LugendresFactorizer class can be used to solve similar problems.<br>
An example is given in the Query class.<br>
Well, it's just a practice code, so don't expect much.<br>
