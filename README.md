# FactorialSolver
 Computation tool for solving factorial problems

Have you ever seen a problem like the following?
"Find the smallest positive integer n such that n! has 290 zeros at the end of the number."

Legendre's formula can be used in such cases.
I actually wrote some Java code to check it out.

This LugendresFactorizer class can be used to solve similar problems.
An example is given in the Query class.
Well, it's just a practice code, so don't expect much.
